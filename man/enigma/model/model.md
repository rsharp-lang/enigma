### Create the machine learning model
 
 Performing machine learning involves creating a model, which is trained
 on some training data and then can process additional data to make predictions.
 Various types of models have been used and researched for machine 
 learning systems.

+ [ANN](model/ANN.1) ### create artificial neural network
+ [xgboost](model/xgboost.1) ### XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting)
+ [randomForest](model/randomForest.1) 
+ [randomForest.regression](model/randomForest.regression.1) 
+ [svm](model/svm.1) ### Support-vector machines
+ [svr](model/svr.1) 
+ [ANN.regression](model/ANN.regression.1) 
+ [snapshot](model/snapshot.1) make the snapshot of the machine learning model
+ [readModelFile](model/readModelFile.1) load saved machine learning model
