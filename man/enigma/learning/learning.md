## machine learning toolkit
 
 Machine learning (ML) is a field of inquiry devoted to
 understanding and building methods that "learn" – that
 is, methods that leverage data to improve performance 
 on some set of tasks. It is seen as a part of artificial
 intelligence.

 Machine learning algorithms build a model based On sample
 data, known As training data, In order To make predictions
 Or decisions without being explicitly programmed To Do so.
 Machine learning algorithms are used In a wide variety Of 
 applications, such As In medicine, email filtering, speech 
 recognition, agriculture, And computer vision, where it Is
 difficult Or unfeasible To develop conventional algorithms 
 To perform the needed tasks.

 A subset Of machine learning Is closely related To computational 
 statistics, which focuses On making predictions Using computers,
 but Not all machine learning Is statistical learning. The 
 study Of mathematical optimization delivers methods, theory 
 And application domains To the field Of machine learning. Data
 mining Is a related field Of study, focusing On exploratory 
 data analysis through unsupervised learning.

 Some implementations Of machine learning use data And neural 
 networks In a way that mimics the working Of a biological 
 brain.

 In its application across business problems, machine learning 
 Is also referred to as predictive analytics.
