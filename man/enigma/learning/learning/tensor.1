.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
create a new machine learning model
 
 In mathematics, a tensor is an algebraic object that describes
 a multilinear relationship between sets of algebraic objects 
 related to a vector space. Tensors may map between different 
 objects such as vectors, scalars, and even other tensors. There
 are many types of tensors, including scalars and vectors (which 
 are the simplest tensors), dual vectors, multilinear maps between 
 vector spaces, and even some operations such as the dot product.
 Tensors are defined independent of any basis, although they are 
 often referred to by their components in a basis related to a 
 particular coordinate system.
