        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p><br /> Artificial neural networks (ANNs), or connectionist systems, are <br /> computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks<br /> that constitute animal brains. Such systems "learn" to perform <br /> tasks by considering examples, generally without being programmed <br /> with any task-specific rules.<br /><br /> An ANN Is a model based On a collection Of connected units Or nodes<br /> called "artificial neurons", which loosely model the neurons In a <br /> biological brain. Each connection, Like the synapses In a biological <br /> brain, can transmit information, a "signal", from one artificial <br /> neuron To another. An artificial neuron that receives a signal can<br /> process it And Then signal additional artificial neurons connected <br /> To it. In common ANN implementations, the signal at a connection <br /> between artificial neurons Is a real number, And the output Of Each <br /> artificial neuron Is computed by some non-linear Function Of the sum <br /> Of its inputs. The connections between artificial neurons are called <br /> "edges". Artificial neurons And edges typically have a weight that <br /> adjusts As learning proceeds. The weight increases Or decreases the<br /> strength Of the signal at a connection. Artificial neurons may have <br /> a threshold such that the signal Is only sent If the aggregate signal<br /> crosses that threshold. Typically, artificial neurons are aggregated <br /> into layers. Different layers may perform different kinds Of transformations <br /> On their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer)<br /> To the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the<br /> layers multiple times.<br /><br /> The original goal Of the ANN approach was To solve problems In the<br /> same way that a human brain would. However, over time, attention <br /> moved To performing specific tasks, leading To deviations from biology. <br /> Artificial neural networks have been used On a variety Of tasks,<br /> including computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation,<br /> social network filtering, playing board And video games And medical <br /> diagnosis.<br /><br /> Deep learning consists Of multiple hidden layers In an artificial <br /> neural network. This approach tries To model the way the human brain <br /> processes light And sound into vision And hearing. Some successful <br /> applications Of deep learning are computer vision And speech recognition.</p>
