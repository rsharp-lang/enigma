    <p><h2>machine learning toolkit</h2>


 
 Machine learning (ML) is a field of inquiry devoted to
 understanding and building methods that "learn" – that
 is, methods that leverage data to improve performance 
 on some set of tasks. It is seen as a part of artificial
 intelligence.

 Machine learning algorithms build a model based On sample
 data, known As training data, In order To make predictions
 Or decisions without being explicitly programmed To Do so.
 Machine learning algorithms are used In a wide variety Of 
 applications, such As In medicine, email filtering, speech 
 recognition, agriculture, And computer vision, where it Is
 difficult Or unfeasible To develop conventional algorithms 
 To perform the needed tasks.

 A subset Of machine learning Is closely related To computational 
 statistics, which focuses On making predictions Using computers,
 but Not all machine learning Is statistical learning. The 
 study Of mathematical optimization delivers methods, theory 
 And application domains To the field Of machine learning. Data
 mining Is a related field Of study, focusing On exploratory 
 data analysis through unsupervised learning.

 Some implementations Of machine learning use data And neural 
 networks In a way that mimics the working Of a biological 
 brain.

 In its application across business problems, machine learning 
 Is also referred to as predictive analytics.</p>

 In mathematics, a tensor is an algebraic object that describes
 a multilinear relationship between sets of algebraic objects 
 related to a vector space. Tensors may map between different 
 objects such as vectors, scalars, and even other tensors. There
 are many types of tensors, including scalars and vectors (which 
 are the simplest tensors), dual vectors, multilinear maps between 
 vector spaces, and even some operations such as the dot product.
 Tensors are defined independent of any basis, although they are 
 often referred to by their components in a basis related to a 
 particular coordinate system.</td>

  <td><h3>Split a Dataset into Train and Test Sets</h3>


 
 The train-test split is used to estimate the performance
 of machine learning algorithms that are applicable for 
 prediction-based Algorithms/Applications. This method is 
 a fast and easy procedure to perform such that we can 
 compare our own machine learning model results to machine
 results. By default, the Test set is split into 30 f 
 actual data and the training set is split into 70f the 
 actual data.
 
 We need To split a dataset into train And test sets To 
 evaluate how well our machine learning model performs. The
 train Set Is used To fit the model, And the statistics Of
 the train Set are known. The second Set Is called the test
 data Set, this Set Is solely used For predictions.</td>
